This is an API and UI to authenticate and interact with my various servers (Game Servers, Databases, Custom Smart Home gadgets, ECT.)

While writing this application, I learned alot about Golang, different communication protocols, and authentication with JWT.
Building this project enabled me to build more custom projects ranging from IoT smart home devices, mobile apps, and more.
